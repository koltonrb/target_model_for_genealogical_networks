# target_model_for_genealogical_networks

This code base accompanies "The Target Model for Genealogical Networks," a master's thesis submitted to Brigham Young University by Kolton Baldwin.  A copy of the thesis is available here: https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/9985/. The main algorith (see Chapter 4) is implemented in family_model_intergenerational_marriage.py while the variant algorithm (see Chapter 5) is implemented in family_model_intergenerational_marriage_reduced.py.
